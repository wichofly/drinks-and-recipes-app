## Technologies Used

- **React 19 + Vite**
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand** â€” state management
- **Zod** â€” runtime schema validation
- **TailwindCSS v4** â€” styling
- **[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/react/transition#transitioning-on-initial-mount)** â€” accessible modal
- **[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)** â€” icons
- **Axios** â€” API requests

## Key Technologies Explained

- **[Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction)**
  Manages global state with slices (recipes, favorites, UI). It can divide main store into smaller individual stores to achieve modularity, using [Slices Pattern](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/guides/slices-pattern). Also includes persistent state for favorites using `zustand/persist`, favorites list is stored in localStorage under the key favorite-store. This is simple to accomplish in Zustand!.

- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)**
  Validates and parses API responses. Keeps types in sync with actual data from TheCocktailDB.

- **CSS Loaders**
  A custom rotating ball loader from [cssloaders.github.io](https://cssloaders.github.io/) shows during async operations.

- **Suspense Hook**
  Wraps lazy-loaded routes to show a loading indicator while waiting for the page to load nad recipes searched.

- **Lazy Hook**
  Reduces initial bundle size by dynamically loading the `IndexPage` and `FavoritePage` only when needed.

- **[Modal](https://headlessui.com/react/transition#examples)**
  Displays detailed recipe information in a clean, accessible, animated dialog.

- **[Notification](https://headlessui.com/react/transition#examples)**
  Provides user feedback using toast notifications with icons and transition effects.
