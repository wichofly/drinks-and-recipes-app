## Technologies Used

- **React 19 + Vite**

- **Zustand** â€” state management

## Key Technologies Explained

- **Zustand**
  Manages global state with slices (recipes, favorites, UI). Includes persistent state for favorites using `zustand/persist`.

- **Zod**
  Validates and parses API responses. Keeps types in sync with actual data from TheCocktailDB.

- **CSS Loaders**
  A custom rotating ball loader from [cssloaders.github.io](https://cssloaders.github.io/) shows during async operations.

- **Suspense Hook**
  Wraps lazy-loaded routes to show a loading indicator while waiting for the page to load nad recipes searched.

- **Lazy Hook**
  Reduces initial bundle size by dynamically loading the `IndexPage` and `FavoritePage` only when needed.

- **Modal** (`@headlessui/react`)
  Displays detailed recipe information in a clean, accessible, animated dialog.

- **Notification** (`@headlessui/react`)
  Provides user feedback using toast notifications with icons and transition effects.
